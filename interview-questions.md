# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a version control on our local working station, such as my laptop.
               GitHub is online working version control, all the developers work together.

  Researched answer: Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.



2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: &&(and), ||(or), !(ban) , >,<,==,===, >=, <=

  Researched answer: Equality operators,relational operators, Logical operators.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: Index is the position in the array. And the value is stored in the each position of the array.

  Researched answer:The index property is a read-only property. It contains the position of a regular expression match within a string. JavaScript values are the values that comprise values like Booleans, Strings, arrays, numbers, etc. Its behavior is the same as other programming languages as values are possessing some definite properties which is being used as per the requirement and run time environment while executing the JavaScript.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is a function that process more than one time in a certain circumstance.

  Researched answer: Iteration is the process of executing a block of code over and over again until a condition is met. There are particular data types that are conducive to iterations; particularly data types with length properties such as strings and arrays.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Two roles in pair programming, navigator and driver, there can be more than one navigators, and only one driver. And they can switch roles back and force. The purpose of pair programming can enhance the efficiency of coding.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: I think "No one will drop from the team" attitude will help us a lot thru the cohort journey. And also the syllabus has everything we need to know. It is the very helpful manual book in our developer career.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. GitHub pull request: Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

2. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function is a function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function . Higher order function is in contrast to first order functions, which don't take a function as an argument or return a function as output.

3. Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly.

4. Objects: In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

5. Classes: Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.
